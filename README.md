In this file I will explain how to your own containers using your docker image and docker-compose:
First, make sure you have a functional GitHub Account, if it's not the case, do it.
Then fork the repository and open a terminal.
Clone the project TD7A4 using -git clone command
Finally open a terminal, go inside the file you forked with cd command, and write:
docker-compose up
Finally go to http://localhost:5000 and see the results.
You can also go to http://localhost:5000/animals to see the database content.
If you modify content.txt file, then this will appear in the http://localhost:5000 after a refresh
